Users also seek information and advice, but generative AI is distinguished by its ability to produce creative and digital outputs that go beyond traditional web search engines. AI is used both at work and outside work, with intents categorized broadly as Asking (seeking information/advice), Doing (producing output), and Expressing (self-expression). Additionally, AI can serve as co-workers producing output or as co-pilots providing advice to improve human productivity. Overall, people employ AI flexibly for work tasks, creative production, problem-solving, and personal expression.'"

According to the context, folks aren’t just using AI as a basic tool to grind through tasks—they’re leveraging ChatGPT as a *decision-support wizard* and research assistant in their workflows. This means AI is turbocharging their brainpower by boosting the *quality* of their decision-making, especially in knowledge-heavy gigs where smarter choices equal bigger wins.\\n\\nThe true money move? Using AI not only to automate or augment labor but to *advise* and *empower* humans to work smarter, not just harder. Since decision quality spikes output, users are unlocking serious productivity boosts that translate into higher earnings and valuable economic surplus. In fact, estimates show US users would demand a hefty $98 payoff to skip AI for a month, reflecting a staggering minimum of $97 billion annual surplus sparked by generative AI’s mojo.\\n\\nSo, AI isn’t just an assistant; it’s like a secret sauce for leveling up income by juicing human intellect, turning complex decisions into gold mines. That’s how AI helps people make bank—by being the dopest sidekick for brainpower and workflow mastery. Boom!'"
